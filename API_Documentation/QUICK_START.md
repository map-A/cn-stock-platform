## 📋 Core Concepts

### Three-Tier Architecture

1. **Pages** - User-facing screens (e.g., Stock Detail, Dashboard)
   - What users see and interact with
   - Required components and widgets
   - Data displayed and actions available

2. **Services** - Backend APIs (e.g., Stock Service, Portfolio Service)
   - HTTP endpoints
   - Request/response formats
   - Business logic

3. **Data Models** - Shared data structures (e.g., StockQuote, Holding)
   - TypeScript interfaces
   - Data types and validation
   - Relationships between entities

### Example Flow
```
User sees Stock Detail Page
    ↓
Page requests data from Stock Service APIs
    ↓
Service returns StockQuote and FinancialMetrics data models
    ↓
Page renders components using data
```
